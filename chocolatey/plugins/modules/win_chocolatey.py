module: win_chocolatey
version_added: '0.1.9'
short_description: Manage packages using chocolatey
description:
- Manage packages using Chocolatey.
- If Chocolatey is missing from the system, the module will install it.
- If there are multiple installations of choco.exe in env:PATH, it will use the first found one
requirements:
- chocolatey >= 0.10.5 (will be upgraded if older)
options:
  allow_empty_checksums:
    description:
    - Allow empty checksums to be used for downloaded resource from non-secure
      locations.
    - Use M(chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey_feature) with the name C(allowEmptyChecksums) to
      control this option globally.
    type: bool
    default: false
    version_added: '0.2.2'
  allow_multiple:
    description:
    - This option is deprecated and will be removed in v2.0.0 of this collection.
      Chocolatey CLI has L(deprecated side-by-side installations, https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/2787)
      as of its v1.2.0 release and plans to remove them in its v2.0.0 release.
    - Chocolatey CLI (choco) v2.0.0 and higher do not support this option.
      This module will return an error if this option is enabled and the
      installed version of Chocolatey CLI on the client is v2.0.0 or higher.
    - Allow the installation of multiple packages when I(version) is specified.
    - Having multiple packages at different versions can cause issues if the
      package doesn't support this. Use at your own risk.
    - The value of this parameter is ignored if I(state) is C(absent). Instead,
      this parameter is automatically configured to remove all versions if
      I(version) is not specified, and the specific version only if I(version)
      is specified.
    type: bool
    default: false
    version_added: '0.2.8'
  allow_prerelease:
    description:
    - Allow the installation of pre-release packages.
    - If I(state) is C(latest), the latest pre-release package will be
      installed.
    type: bool
    default: false
    version_added: '0.2.6'
  architecture:

  bootstrap_script:
    description:
    - Specify the bootstrap script URL that can be used to install Chocolatey
      if it is not already present on the system.
    - Use this parameter when I(name) is C(chocolatey) to ensure that a
      custom bootstrap script is used.
    - If neither this parameter nor I(source) is set, the bootstrap script
      url will be C(https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1)
    - If this parameter is not set, and I(source) is set to a url, the
      bootstrap script url will be determined from that url instead.
    - This parameter only defines which bootstrap script is used to download
      and install Chocolatey. To define the URL to a specific Chocolatey
      nupkg to install, note that many bootstrap scripts respect the value
      of the C(chocolateyDownloadUrl) environment variable, which can be set
      for the task as well.

    description:
    - Parameters to pass to the package's chocolateyInstall script.
    - These are parameters specific to the Chocolatey package and are generally
      documented by the package itself.

    aliases: [ params ]
  choco_args:
    description:
    - Additional parameters to pass to choco.exe
    - These may be any additional parameters to pass through directly to

    - This is ignored when C(state=absent).
    type: bool

  proxy_url:
    description:
    - Proxy URL used to install chocolatey and the package.
    - Use M(chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey_config) with the name C(proxy) to control this
      option globally.
    type: str
    version_added: '0.2.4'
  proxy_username:
    description:
    - Proxy username used to install Chocolatey and the package.
    - Before Ansible 2.7, users with double quote characters C(") would need to
      be escaped with C(\) beforehand. This is no longer necessary.
    - Use M(chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey_config) with the name C(proxyUser) to control this
      option globally.
    type: str

  source:
    description:
    - Specify the source to retrieve the package from.
    - Use M(chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey_source) to manage global sources.
    - This value can either be the URL to a Chocolatey feed, a path to a folder
      containing C(.nupkg) packages or the name of a source defined by
      M(chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey_source).
    - When Chocolatey is not yet installed, prefer using I(bootstrap_script)
      instead to determine where to pull the bootstrap script from.
    - This value may also be used when Chocolatey is not installed as the
      location of the install.ps1 script if I(bootstrap_script) is not set, and
      only supports URLs for this case.
      In this case, if the URL ends in ".ps1", it is used as-is. Otherwise,
      if the URL appears to contain a "/repository/" fragment, the module
      will attempt to append "/install.ps1" to find an install script. If
      neither of these checks pass, the module will strip off the URL path and
      try to find an "/install.ps1" from the root of the server.
    type: str
  source_username:
    description:
    - A username to use with I(source) when accessing a feed that requires
      authentication.
    - It is recommended you define the credentials on a source with
      M(chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey_source) instead of passing it per task.
    type: str
    version_added: '0.2.7'
  source_password:
    description:
    - The password for I(source_username).
    - This value is exposed as a command argument and any privileged account
      can see this value when the module is running Chocolatey, define the
      credentials with a source with M(chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey_source) to avoid this.
    type: str
    version_added: '0.2.7'
  state:
    description:
    - State of the package on the system.
    - When C(absent), will ensure the package is not installed.
    - When C(present), will ensure the package is installed.
    - When C(downgrade), will allow Chocolatey to downgrade a package if
      I(version) is older than the installed version.
    - When C(latest) or C(upgrade), will ensure the package is installed to the latest
      available version.
    - When C(reinstalled), will uninstall and reinstall the package.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, downgrade, upgrade, latest, present, reinstalled ]
    default: present
  timeout:
    description:
    - The time (in seconds) to allow chocolatey to finish before timing out.
    type: int
    default: 2700
    version_added: '0.2.3'
    aliases: [ execution_timeout ]
  validate_certs:
    description:
    - Used when downloading the Chocolatey install script if Chocolatey is not
      already installed, this does not affect the Chocolatey package install
      process.
    - When C(no), no SSL certificates will be validated.
    - This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed
      certificate.
    type: bool
    default: true
    version_added: '0.2.7'
  version:
    description:
    - Specific version of the package to be installed.
    - When I(state) is set to C(absent), will uninstall the specific version
      otherwise all versions of that package will be removed.
    - When I(state) is set to C(present) and the package is already installed
      at a version that does not match, this task fails.
    - If a different version of package is already installed, I(state) must be
      C(latest), C(upgrade), or C(downgrade), or I(force) must be set to C(true) to install
      the desired version.
    - Provide as a string (e.g. C('6.1')), otherwise it is considered to be
      a floating-point number and depending on the locale could become C(6,1),
      which will cause a failure.
    - If I(name) is set to C(chocolatey) and Chocolatey is not installed on the
      host, this will be the version of Chocolatey that is installed. You can
      also set the C(chocolateyVersion) environment var.
    type: str
notes:
- This module will install or upgrade Chocolatey when needed.
- When using verbosity 2 or less (C(-vv)) the C(stdout) output will be restricted.
  When using verbosity 4 (C(-vvvv)) the C(stdout) output will be more verbose.
  When using verbosity 5 (C(-vvvvv)) the C(stdout) output will include debug output.
- Some packages, like hotfixes or updates need an interactive user logon in
  order to install. You can use C(become) to achieve this, see
  :ref:`become_windows`.
  Even if you are connecting as local Administrator, using C(become) to
  become Administrator will give you an interactive user logon, see examples
  below.
- If C(become) is unavailable, use M(ansible.windows.win_hotfix) to install hotfixes instead
  of M(chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey) as M(ansible.windows.win_hotfix) avoids using C(wusa.exe) which cannot
  be run without C(become).
- From Chocolatey CLI 2.0.0 and above, the minimum .NET Framework version required
  was changed to .NET Framework 4.8.
  If this requirement is not met, and a 1.x version of Chocolatey CLI is not specified,
  then M(chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey) will not attempt to install Chocolatey CLI.
  See the examples section below for one method of meeting the .NET Framework 4.8
  requirement and also refer to the L(Chocolatey documentation,https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/guides/upgrading-to-chocolatey-v2-v6)
  for more information about Chocolatey CLI 2.0.0.

# TODO:
# * Better parsing when a package has dependencies - currently fails
# * Time each item that is run
# * Support 'changed' with gems - would require shelling out to `gem list` first and parsing, kinda defeating the point of using chocolatey.
# * Version provided not as string might be translated to 6,6 depending on Locale (results in errors)
